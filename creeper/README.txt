======= SETUP INSTRUCTIONS =========

- download the 2.0.3 version of tarzan here : http://tarzan-aws.googlecode.com/files/tarzan_2.0.3.zip

- Then unzip inside the creeper module directory and rename the folder named "tarzan_2.0.3" to "tarzan".

- Move the file config.inc.php into the newly created tarzan directory.

- Then install it via the admin console of drupal and go in the Tarzan configuration menu in the admin section to fill your AWS account settings.

- You can now use the Tarzan API in every module you will create that add a dependency to the creeper module ;-)
