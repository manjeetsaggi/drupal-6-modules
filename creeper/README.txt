======= SETUP INSTRUCTIONS =========

- Check out the latest cloudfusion code from http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/source/checkout into the creeper cloudfusion subdirectory

You can do it with the command-line by moving into your creeper directory and running 

svn checkout http://tarzan-aws.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ cloudfusion


- Move the file config.inc.php into the cloudfusion directory.

- Then install it via the admin console of drupal and go in the Cloudfusion configuration menu in the admin section to fill your AWS account settings.

- You can now use the Cloudfusion API in every module you will create that add a dependency to the creeper module ;-)
