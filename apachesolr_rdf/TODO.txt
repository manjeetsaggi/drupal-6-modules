These are just the little TODOs, bigger ones (like facets, â€¦) will have entries
in the issue queue.

* Example search queries in README (maybe seperate READMEs for different
  schemas?)
* Provide richer search results
* Use theme function for theming single search results according to type or
  other properties
* Index resources with correct data types in "dynamic fields" schema
* Is it useful to be able to create the same index on several servers? If not,
  resources to be indexed could/should be assigned directly to servers.
* Rename "index" to "index component" for clarity
