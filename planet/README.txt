This module allows site administrators to associate a feed with users who belong
to a given role and to display it in a "planet" fashion. Feed items can be
auto-converted to blogs if categories or the post itself contains a snippet
specified in the planet settings, or posts can be converted manually.

The idea is that it's nice in some cases to aggregate a group's personal blogs,
promoting to prime time only those posts which are relevant to the site's purpose.


Installation
------------

1. Copy the planet directory into your Drupal modules directory.

2. Go to admin/modules and enable the planet module.

3. To perform further configuration (and to add feeds), go to admin/settings/planet.
